## Features

- **Dashboard**: Overview with statistics and quick navigation
- **Branch Management**: CRUD operations for library branches
- **Librarian Management**: Staff management with branch assignments
- **Book Catalog**: Book management with search functionality
- **Member Registration**: Member management with different membership types
- **Loan Management**: Book borrowing and returns with automatic fine calculation
- **Overdue Tracking**: Monitor and manage overdue books

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Java Spring Boot 3.x with Spring Data JPA
- **Database**: MySQL (MariaDB compatible)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript with Thymeleaf templates
- **API**: RESTful web services

## Entity Sets

1. **Branch** - Library branches/locations
2. **Librarian** - Library staff members
3. **Book** - Book catalog (master records)
4. **BookCopy** - Physical copies of books at branches
5. **Member** - Library members/patrons
6. **Loan** - Book borrowing transactions

## Relationships

- Branch 1:N Librarian (A branch has many librarians)
- Branch 1:N BookCopy (A branch has many book copies)
- Book 1:N BookCopy (A book has many copies)
- Member 1:N Loan (A member can have many loans)
- BookCopy 1:N Loan (A copy can have many loan records)
- Librarian 1:N Loan (A librarian processes many loans)

## Database Setup

1. Install MySQL Server
2. Run the schema script:
```sql
source sql/schema.sql
```
3. Load sample data:
```sql
source sql/sample_data.sql
```

## Configuration

**IMPORTANT: Never commit database credentials to version control!**

### Option 1: Environment Variables (Recommended)

Set the following environment variables before running the application:

```bash
export DB_URL=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/library_db
export DB_USERNAME=your_db_username
export DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
```

### Option 2: Local Properties File

1. Copy `src/main/resources/application.properties.example` to `application-local.properties`
2. Update the credentials in `application-local.properties`
3. This file is git-ignored and will not be committed

The application is configured to use environment variables by default. See `application.properties.example` for the template.
